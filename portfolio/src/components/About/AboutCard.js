            I'm currently living in Hanoi.
            <br />
            Along with learning programming, I also participate in extracurricular activities. 
            <br />
            I am the president of a club and participate in many youth union activities. It helps me develop many soft skills to complement my programming skills.
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
